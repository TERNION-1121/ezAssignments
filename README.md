# ezAssignments

A project to simplify assignment-making tasks.

Try running `main.py`. It takes the text written in `assignment.txt` and creates a new docx file by the name `assignment.docx`.

If you wish to add new questions for your own usage purposes, follow the convention used to write the original `assignment.txt`

> P.S. A better readme's coming soon...
