SUB
Cubes each of volume 64 cm3 are joined end to end. 
Find the surface area of the resulting cuboid.


SUB
A pen stand made of wood is in the shape of a cuboid with four conical depressions
and a cubical depression to hold the pens and pins, respectively. The dimension of
the cuboid is 10 cm, 5 cm and 4 cm. The radius of each of the conical depressions
is 0.5 cm, and the depth is 2.1 cm. The edge of the cubical depression is 3 cm. Find
the volume of the wood in the entire stand.


SUB
